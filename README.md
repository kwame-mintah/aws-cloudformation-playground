# üõù AWS CloudFormation Playground

As the name of the repository suggests, it's just a [_playground_](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/playground).
Will be used to store various [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) stack templates for deploying
and configuring various resources.

## Development

The following tools are quite helpful when developing locally, [`cfn-lint`](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-lint) for linting CloudFormation files and
[LocalStack](https://www.localstack.cloud/) for testing resource deployment locally, also see [aws-localstack-playground](https://github.com/kwame-mintah/aws-localstack-playground/) providing example(s).

- [cfn-lint-visual-studio-code](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-lint-visual-studio-code): CloudFormation Linter IDE integration, autocompletion, and documentation
